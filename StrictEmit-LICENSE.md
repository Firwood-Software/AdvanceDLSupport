AdvancedDLSupport uses a sister project called StrictEmit, also created and distributed by Firwood Software. The public release of StrictEmit is released under the GPLv3. 

AdvancedDLSupport's public release, however, is released under the LGPLv3. Firwood has an internal license to use StrictEmit under the terms of the LGPLv3 with AdvancedDLSupport instead of GPLv3. In full, the license is as such:

## License Grant
Firwood Software (the "Licensor") hereby grants itself (the "Licensee") a royalty-free, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual license (the "License") to use, modify, and redistribute StrictEmit (the "Library") in the AdvancedDLSupport library ("AdvancedDLSupport") under the provisions of the Lesser General Public License, version 3.

This License grant is granted to the Licensee only, and not its users, sublicensees, or consumers (the "Users"). Should AdvancedDLSupport Users wish to use the Library independently of AdvancedDLSupport, they are subject to full Lesser General Public License, version 3 (or another custom licensing agreement, if applicable). Independent use includes, but is not limited to, any usage of the programming interfaces, binary code, source code, or functionality (the "API") of the Library that is not exposed as a direct result or requirement of using AdvancedDLSupport.

This copyright notice must be distributed with AdvancedDLSupport whereever appropriate, such as license disclosures or existing license terms.

The License can be revoked by the Licensor at any point for any reason.

## What does this mean for me, the end user?
In short, you can use ADL under the LGPLv3 without any extra problems or requirements. You are only subject to StrictEmit's GPLv3 license if you are using it (either through its public release, or by using API from it).

ADL itself does not expose any API from StrictEmit.
